One of the first lines in the main Python code is the version tuple:
ver = (0, 0, 0, 'a')

The meaning of the first three numbers is obvious (if it's not, ask someone).
The 'a' means Alpha -- meaning instable, incomplete, not ready for anyone to run. Other values:
'b': Beta, it does something, but is still not quite ready for public use.
If the letter is absent, it is a final release.
